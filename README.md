# Machine-Maintenance-and-Failure

Manufacturing companies rely heavily on machines to produce their goods and it is vital for them that the machines are working when they need them to work and do not break down unexpectedly. <b>The main objective of the Project is mining of the data set is to assess and explore industrial production machine maintenance data to build a predictive model to predict machine failure.<b>
  
  
<b>The data mining has been done using SAS Enterprise Miner<b>
  
# Data 
  
The chosen dataset for analysis is the A141 2020 Predictive Maintenance Dataset which was obtained from UCI. This dataset is a synthetic dataset that reflects real world maintenance data encountered in the industry that is used for predictive maintenance.
