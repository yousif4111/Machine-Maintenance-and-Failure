# Machine-Maintenance-and-Failure

Manufacturing companies rely heavily on machines to produce their goods and it is vital for them that the machines are working when they need them to work and do not break down unexpectedly. <b>The main objective of the Project is mining of the data set is to assess and explore industrial production machine maintenance data to build a predictive model to predict machine failure.<b>
  
  
<b>The data mining has been done using SAS Enterprise Miner<b>
